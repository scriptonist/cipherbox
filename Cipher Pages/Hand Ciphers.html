        Hand ciphers, also known as pencil-and-paper ciphers or
        field ciphers by the military, are encryption methods
        that are performed with pencil and paper. Many of these
        classical cipher were developed in two-thousand years of
        cryptography. With each new cipher that was developed,
        codebreakers found new attacks to break them, and
        codemakers improved their ciphers and devised new
        methodes to elevate the security of their ciphers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Hand ciphers have always been a
        compromise between security and practical considerations.
        Very secure ciphers were often very elaborate,
        unpractical and prone to errors. This was a disadvantage
        in tactical circumstances. On the other hand, practical
        and less complex ciphers were often weak. Nonetheless,
        these insecure ciphers proved to be interesting in some
        tactical circumstances where time to break them would
        exceed the tactical life span of the message.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">On this page you will find some methods
        and techniques that are the result of many years of
        evolution in cryptography. I won't go through the simple
        types like Ceasars Shift, ROT-13 or all kinds of Vigenere
        variations that are easy to break with nothing more than
        pencil and paper, but will focus on the more complex
        ciphers that earned their stripes in the 20th century.
        Some of the explained techniques can be useful to develop
        your own hand cipher.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="2">One-time Pad</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">The one-time pad encryption is a
        special kind of paper-and-pencil cipher and has its own
        section on this website. Please visit the </font><a href="http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/onetimepad.htm"><font size="2">one-time pad page</font></a><font size="2"> for more details.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="2">Double Transposition</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">The double transposition or double
        columnar transposition was probably the most secure and
        most popular field cipher during the Second World War. It
        was used by both Allied and Axis forces and a regular
        change of good keys ensured a very good resistance
        against cryptanalytic attacks. At the same time it was
        rather easy to apply, although time consuming for long
        messages. One disadvantage is that letter frequency
        analysis will show a normal linguistic distribution,
        similar to plaintext, which points to transposition. When
        enough ciphertext available, encrypted with with the same
        key, an attack by anagramming could be successful,
        although very difficult. A very effective way to beat the
        anagramming is to first fractionate the characters of the
        plaintext (see further).</font></p>

        and <strong>CONSPIRACY</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Now we can make our first
        transposition. Create a matrix and write the first
        keyword in that matrix. Beneath the keyword we write the
        sequence of how we will read off the letters. Assign 1 to
        the keyword letter that is first in the alphabet. The
        second letter 2 and so on. If two identical letters occur
        in the keyword the most left letter will get the lowest
        digit.</font></p>

        column by column according to the key order sequence and

        </tbody></table>
        <p><font size="2">To decipher the double transposition we
        work in exactly the opposite direction. First, we create
        a matrix with the second keyword and determine the long
        and short columns (free places at the end) according to
        the message length. The ciphertext is written into the
        matrix,, column by column, according to the keyword
        sequence. Next, we create the matrix for the first
        keyword, also determine the long and short columns
        according to the message length and read off the matrix
        from the second keyword row by row and write it into the
        matrix of the first matrix, column by column, according
        to the keyword sequence of that matrix. Finally we read
        off the plaintext row by row.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Note that in reality much larger
        keywords or key sentences, 20 letters or more, are used
        to enable the encryption of large pieces of plaintext.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="2">Disrupted Transpositions</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">The disrupted transposition is as a
        further complication to the normal transposition. Instead
        of filling the matrix row by row, the rows are all filled
        in a very irregular fashion, resulting in two separate
        areas. This results in a very complex transposition of
        the characters. First, we determine the exact number of
        rows and columns to fill (don't forget to complete with
        X's until we have a final group of five letters) Next we
        fill a row until we reach the digit from the keyword
        sequence. If the first digit is at the 8th place, we will
        only fill that row up to that position. We continue the
        next row until the second position and so on. If we have
        reached the end position of the last line we continue by
        filling the remaining empty places at each line. In our
        example the difference between the two areas is visible
        by the lower and upper case characters.</font></p>

        triangular areas. Again, we read off by the columns,
        according to the keyword sequence. As you can see the
        second method will result in a very different ciphertext.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Usually the disruption method is used
        in one of the two transpositions of a double
        transposition, making it much stronger. Probably the most
        powerful German wartime hand ciphers was </font><a href="http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/rasterschlussel44.htm"><font size="2">Rasterschlüssel
        44</font></a><font size="2">, a grid based cipher that
        disrupted the text rows by a grid, followed by columnar
        transposition.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="2">Fractionation</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">Ciphers that are based purely on
        transposition reveal statistical information when
        subjected to letter frequency analysis. Breaking up or
        fractionating letters before moving them around improves
        the security of a cipher considerably. A simple matrix
        can break up letters into a horizontal and vertical
        coordinate. This Polybius square is the easiest way to
        apply fractionation on plaintext. A scrambled alphabet
        can be used to complicate the matrix. Of course,
        fractionation offers no cryptographic strength unless
        combined with other techniques. The Polybius square on
        itselfe is a very weak mono-alphabetic substitution
        cipher. The Russian Nihilist cipher used a keyword
        scrambled polybius square where the plaintext digits were
        added to a fixed number of digits, derived by a keyword
        from the square. It was basically a pimped Vigenere
        encryption and simple to break. So, good idea to use this
        fractionation, bad idea to use it without combining it
        with other techniques.</font></p>

        <h3><font size="2">The Straddling Checkerboard</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">An important Russian improvement to the
        fractionation of the Nihilist cipher is the straddling
        checkerboard. Letters in a normal matrix are broken up
        into ever equal parts. The checkerboard however produces
        a most irregular pattern. Some letters are represented by
        one digit, others by two digits. By assigning the most
        frequent letters to one-digit values the resulting
        ciphertext will be smaller than a normal Nihilist cipher.
        Also, the irregular pattern of digits makes it much more
        difficult to retrieve the matrix combinations. As a
        further complication one could fill the matrix with a
        scrambled alphabet instead of the default alphabetic
        sequence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The combination of fractionation and
        transposition proved to be very secure. A good example of
        such a combination is the VIC Cipher with double
        transposition and straddling checkerboard, used by
        Russian intelligence during the Cold War. The cipher
        resisted all cryptanalytic attacks for several years
        until the agent who used it defected to the US.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">It's easy to convert the digits back
        into characters and seperate the one-digit values from
        the two-digit values. If a digit combination starts with
        a row number (2 or 6) it's a two-digit code and another
        digit follows. In all other cases it's a one-digit code.
        Again, this fractionation method should always be used in
        combination with other cipher techniques such as
        transpositions or a one-time pad. After converting the
        text into digits one can transposition them or add a
        one-time pad. If used with a transposition, we simply
        transpose digits instead of letter as we do with the
        double transposition cipher. Remember, a checkerboard on
        its own does not provide any encryption nor security.
        Always use it in combinations with some type of
        encryption.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="2">Extending the Straddling Checkerboard</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">The number of one-digit values
        determines the possible number of rows and therefore the
        number of supported characters. The CT-46 table is an
        example of an extended checkerboard. It is optimised for
        use in different languages. Other variations with
        different character sets are possible. Another
        checkerboard variation is TAPIR, used by the former
        East-German intelligence, optimized for German language
        with special German characters and even syllables.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">The Polybius and checkerboard matrices
        cut your characters in two pieces. There are however
        methods to divide them even more, which makes it harder
        to get them puzzled together by the attacker. The Trifid
        cipher works with 3 matrices with 9 characters each. Each
        character is converted into 3 digits: one for the matrix,
        one for the row and one for the column. Of course, we can
        fill the three matrices with a scrambled alphabet. The
        system is easy to expand. With three matrices of four by
        four we can already support 48 characters.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">As with all fractionating ciphers, this
        should always be used in combination with some sort of
        transposition. However, a cryptanalyst would always
        instantly see that the ciphertext contains only the
        digits 1, 2 and 3, and will understand that at least one
        stage of the encryption is a Trifid type cipher. Without
        transposition, he could cut the ciphertext in pieces of
        three digits and treat them as one character of a
        mono-alphabetic substitution, which is very easy to
        break.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">But there are ways to mislead the
        attacker. We can assign several letters to each of the
        three values and randomly pick out one. We need a table
        that says which letters stand for which value. We could
        fool the cryptanalyst even more. If we pick out
        frequently used letters such as ETAOIN more than other
        letters, we can create the illusion that it's not a
        fractionated cipher but a simple transposition, since the
        letter frequency analysis shows a normal distribution.
        The attacker doesn't know that each letter isn't a
        letter, but just one third of any other letter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We give the digits some letters. You
        could use a scrambled alphabet. If you consider extending
        to three matrices of four by four you must take in
        account that digit 4 is used slightly less than the other
        digits (the first digit of a character will never be 4
        since you have only 3 matrices). In that case you it's
        better to assign a few less letters to digit 4 to
        compensate the unequal distribution (less letters to a
        digit means that the individual letters are used more
        often than when you had more choice for that digit).</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">To decipher this, just see which value
        a letter is assigned to and you can recompose the digit
        combinations. Note that a character can be represented by
        many different combinations of three letters. In the
        example we see that the letter E is converted in both NAH
        and WYE. We can also observe that the ciphertext letter A
        is one third of the plaintext letter Y, but also of E and
        T. Even without combining it with transposition, it would
        be very hard to find out that Trifid is used, and even if
        we knew, letter frequency analysis is useless. In
        combination with transposition, we could use one keyword
        to scramble the matrices and the digit-letter
        combinations and one or even two keywords for a single or
        double transposition. A very hard nut to crack.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Let us take this one final step
        further. Four matrices, each a mini straddling
        checkerboard! The irregular result is a code of two or
        three digits, just as the straddling checkerboard, but
        cut in two or three pieces instead of one or two. This
        means more fractionation. The first digit of a code is
        the martrix number. If the letter is in the top row it
        will be a two-digit code. If the letter is in the bottom
        row it will be a three-digit code. In the example I used
        a scrambled alphabet, easy to make with a keyword, as
        explained in the Keywords section. The top rows of the
        matrices contain the top 12 most frequent letters (in
        this case of English). These are E T A O I N S H R D L C.
        It's not hard to fill the matrices with a scrambled
        alphabet. You first mark the top 12 and fill them one by
        one in the top row. Next, you fill the rest of the
        letters into the bottom row. Again, the nr [414] is to
        switch between letters and numbers.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">There are several methods to scramble
        an alphabet with keywords or to stretch them. The most

        by mixing an alphabet in a matrix with one or two
        keywords.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In our fist example we use the single
        keyword ENTERPRISE. First, set up a matrix as wide as the
        keyword, but use each letter only once. Now, there are
        two ways to fill the matrix completely. The first method
        is the fill the matrix with the remaining letters of the
        alphabet. The second method is to also fill in the
        remaining letters, but leave a space for each letter that
        has already been used. The actual mixed alphabet is read
        off column after column, by the order of the top letters.</font></p>

        <h3><font size="2">Generating random digits</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">An easy way to create random digits is
        the Lagged Fibonacci Generator. It is a method also
        called chaining. Note that this is by no means a
        cryptographically secure way of generating numbers, and
        the output randomness depends highly on the initial state
        and size of the generator. However, the chaining methode
        can be usefull as a means of super-encryption or to
        individualise an encryption scheme.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">To perform a chaining, we take add
        first and second digit together modulo 10 and append the
        result at the end of the array of digits. next, we take
        the second and third and so on. The more distance between
        the initial and the generated digits the more complicated
        the relation between initial state and generated digits
        will be.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">This generator can be used to improve
        resistance to cryptanalysis of encryption types such as
        double transposition. We know that a high number of
        ciphertext messages that are encrypted with the same key
        will help cryptanalists to break double transpositions by
        means of multiple anagramming. We can apply the usual
        keywords to create the transposition matrices, but change
        the final transposition sequences for individual
        recipients by adding a secret series of digits. This
        could be the recipient's personal number, a birthday or
        easily memorized number. Although all users have the same
        keys, they all have another transposition result and the
        statistics guys have less material with the same key.
        Even a scheme with a real individual message key for each

        <p><font size="2">Chaining a secret number can also be
        useful as super-encryption. Super-encryption is a second
        encryption on top of a normal encryption. This offers
        additional complexity to an existing encryption. One
        could use it to super-encrypt a one-time pad ciphertext.
        In case of a compromised key, it would not be possible
        for the attacker to simply use the one-time pad to
        decipher the message. The result would appear to be a
        random series of values, and make them believe they have
        the wrong one-time pad. In such a case, the chained

        <h3><font size="2">Knock-Knock</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">An interesting variation on the
        polybius square is what I call Knock-Knock, commonly
        known as Tap Code. It allows a most basic form of
        communication. Where other simple communication methods
        like Morse need at least a light beam or have to produce
        sound to transmit dots as well as lines, Knock-Knock
        requires only pulses that can be transmit in all kinds of
        forms, knocking being the most simple of all. Note that
        this method is only a substitution cipher and therefore
        very easy to break. It should be seen as a method of
        transmission, rather than encryption.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">A simple Tap Code matrix:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">Each transmitted code is formed by the
        combination of rows and columns. According to the matrix,
        the letter M is converted into 32. To transmit, we give 3
        knocks, a small pause and 2 knocks. Take a larger pause
        between the letters. In the example each X represents a
        knock with whatever you have, on any surface (don't use
        your head!). You could use it when your submarine is
        stuck on the bottom of the ocean, when you're trapped
        underneath a building after an earthquake, or to ask
        another inmate in your favorite prison to pass the metal
        saw after he's finished (a disclaimer could be useful
        here).</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">We can create a Letter frequency
        optimised Tap Code matrix. To reduce the number of
        'knocks', required to send the characters, we can assign
        the smallest combinations to the most common letters. The
        six most frequently used letters present about 50 percent
        of text and assigning them short combination will reduce
        transmission time considerably.</font></p>

        <h3><font size="2">Conclusion</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">A secure cipher should have keywords
        that are easy to remember, is easy to apply without
        errors and offer a good security. It should use
        substitution, transposition as well as fractionation to
        resist cryptanalysis. The user must determine whether he
        focuses on security, applicability or speed. The
        encryption techniques as described above provide the
        latest and strongest encryption combinations before the
        era of digitalisation in cryptography and can be a
        guideline to the development of your own encryption
        scheme. Many combinations, extensions and adaptations on
        the above explained techniques are possible. However,
        although attacking some of these ciphers requires
        extensive and complex cryptanalytic techniques, modern
        computational power will be able to break them by brute
        force (with the exception of one-time pad).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Nonetheless, these ciphers still
        require good knowledge of cryptography and/or software
        design to be broken. A ciphertext, produced by an unknown
        secret encryption scheme, could even resist all modern
        techniques when the attacker can't determine the nature
        of the algorithm. As always, cryptography is a
        risk-analysis, a balance between the efforts and costs
        your protection is worth to you, and the amount of
        effort, time and costs the potential attacker is willing
        to spend to break it. Finally, modern cryptography of
        course provides stronger and faster software algorithms,
        and hand ciphers are to be considered as replacement in
        case of unavailability of computers or other encryption
        devices.</font></p>
